This repository contains code that allow segmentation of cells with very high density such as found in brain germinal zones.
It also contains code that compute the density of a tissue using different techniques.

- train : contains code for training segmentation models
- segment : contains code for segmenting real data
- density : contains code as exemple for density computation
- roi : contains code as example for roi analysis

Each file has a name and a version.
Version do not follow github commits for practicity but are manually set
then locked for methodologic purposes.
Old versions are always kept in the "old" directory
